# Coffee Shop Udacity Project Full Stack Nanodegree 👀👩‍💻

This project is a **Coffee Shop** that I do myself for **Udacity**. In this you can add see drinks in the list. If you are barista or manager access to much actions; like get drinks, edit drinks, delete drinks and create drinks. As part of the Fullstack Nanodegree, this serves as practice for **Course 4: ### Identity and Access Management**. In this project, I applied API endpoint structuring, implementation, Authentication with AUTH0, based on role access management strategies to control different types of user.


## Full Stack Nano - I'M Final Project 🧁

Udacity has decided to open a new digitally enabled cafe for students to order drinks, socialize, and study hard. But they need help setting up their menu experience.

You have been called on to demonstrate your newly learned skills to create a full stack drink menu application. The application must:

1) Display graphics representing the ratios of ingredients in each drink.
2) Allow public users to view drink names and graphics.
3) Allow the shop baristas to see the recipe information.
4) Allow the shop managers to create new drinks and edit existing drinks.

## Tasks 🔗🔗

There are `@TODO` comments throughout the project. We recommend tackling the sections in order. Start by reading the READMEs in:

1. [`./backend/`](./backend/README.md)
2. [`./frontend/`](./frontend/README.md)

## About the Stack  🧲🧲🧲

We started the full stack application for you. It is desiged with some key functional areas:

### Backend   ⛏🔑
 
The `./backend` directory contains a partially completed Flask server with a pre-written SQLAlchemy module to simplify your data needs. You will need to complete the required endpoints, configure, and integrate Auth0 for authentication.

[View the README.md within ./backend for more details.](./backend/README.md)

### Frontend  🔬🔬

The `./frontend` directory contains a complete Ionic frontend to consume the data from the Flask server. You will only need to update the environment variables found within (./frontend/src/environment/environment.ts) to reflect the Auth0 configuration details set up for the backend app. 

[View the README.md within ./frontend for more details.](./frontend/README.md)
